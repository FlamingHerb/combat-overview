COMBAT OVERVIEW 1.0.0


	The Combat Overview gives you the power to give you ease in some of the more tedious aspects of combat in Holo_world, Dead Birds or Hounds of War.
	This also allows you to have already prepared sheets in the form of JSON (later on) for you to just do some math and do it easily.


	== DOING INITIATVES ==
	It's simple. First, add some PCs and Monsters to the fray before you click Update Turn, where it will sort out who gets to go first.
